# WarriorFight
This is an engaging C++ program that demonstrates the usage of a public class. It introduces a text-based game where the player interacts with a monster by inputting commands. The player has the option to either attack the monster or attempt to run away.

The code defines a "warrior" class, representing the player character. The warrior has attributes such as a name ("Ironman"), coordinates (x and y), and health points (HP). The program provides functionalities for displaying the warrior's information, moving the warrior to a specified location, performing an attack that generates a random number between 1 and 10, increasing the warrior's health points, and decreasing health points when attacked by the monster.

Additionally, there is a "monster" class in the code. The monster has attributes similar to the warrior, such as coordinates and health points. The monster class includes functionalities for attacking the warrior, decreasing its health points, and moving to the warrior's location.

In the main function, the game continues until either the warrior's or the monster's health points reach zero. During each turn, the player is prompted to choose between moving or attacking. The corresponding actions are performed, and the updated information of both the warrior and the monster is displayed. The game also includes the feature of the warrior's health increasing after each turn. Once the game ends, a message is displayed indicating whether the player won or lost.

Feel free to play the game, interact with the monster, and enjoy your battle!
